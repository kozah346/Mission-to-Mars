# Mission-to-Mars


The following task was done to help Robin polish her web app by adding images of Mars' hemispheres. To do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images and their titles. Scraped data was stored on MongoDB, used a web application to display the data and altered the design of the web app to accomodate these images.
